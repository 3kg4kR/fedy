        <p>
        Fedora Utils lets you install codecs and additional software that
        Fedora doesn't want to ship, like MP3 codecs, Adobe Flash, Oracle Java
        etc. It can also fix problems, tweak and cleanup your system, show
        system information and much more with just few clicks.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition to the GUI, you can also use Fedora Utils in bash scripts
        to help you install software and tweak the sytsem automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
        Fedora Utils saves the downloaded files. Have to do the same steps on
        more than one system? You won't need to redownload the files again.
        Fedora Utils can use previously downloaded files with ease. Combine
        this with the scripting ability, and configuring multiple systems
        becomes a lot easier.
        </p>
        <p>
        Fedora Utils is extensible via plugins. Writing a plugin is easy and
        fun.
