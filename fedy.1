.SH FILES

.SS Configuration files
Fedy supports use of configuration files. The global configuration file is usually
.B /etc/fedyrc
and user-specific configuration file is usually

(unless overriden in the global configuration file). The user specific configurations will be given higher priority than the global configurations. Arguments can override values in configuration files.

Fedy supports plugins for adding more functionality. You can write your own custom plugins for Fedy. The plugin files are usually located under
.B /usr/share/fedy/plugins
