in the menu/overview or type

Fez requires root permissions to perform various tasks.

.SH OPTIONS
Fez supports specifying options for temporarily changing different configuration variables and executing various commands, helpful in case you don't want to change a configuration permanently and want to enable/disable some features just for the session, or execute certain commands without launching the full interface. You can get a list of supported arguments with
.B fez --help

.SH FILES

.SS Configuration files
Fez supports use of configuration files. The global configuration file is usually
.B /etc/fezrc
and user-specific configuration file is usually
.B ~/.fezrc
(unless overriden in the global configuration file). The user specific configurations will be given higher priority than the global configurations. Arguments can override values in configuration files.

.PP
Configuration files can be used for changing configurations, setting value of shell variables (for example setting the proxy), or running any command before starting the GUI.

.SS Plugins
Fez supports plugins for adding more functionality. You can write your own custom plugins for Fez. The plugin files are usually located under
.B /usr/share/fez/plugins
